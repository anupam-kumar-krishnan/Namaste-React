    - Hello World using React
    - Added Script and started writing code in App.js file

    - render method helps to put the content onto the page
    - ReactElement(Object) => HTML(Browser Understandable)
    - createElement API takes in 3 argument
         - Name of the tag
         - Attributes
         - Children
            - If there are multiple children then pass it in an array otherwise as it is
     - Whatever we are passing from root.render, it is getting replaced what is there inside root
    - If there is something on the top or the bottom of the page, we can still use React in that small portion of the page
