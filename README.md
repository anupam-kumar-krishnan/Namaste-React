         I. Name of the tag
         II. Attributes
         III. Children
            - If there are multiple children then pass it in an array otherwise as it is
    - Whatever we are passing from root.render, it is getting replaced what is there inside root
    - If there is something on the top or the bottom of the page, we can still use React in that small portion of the page
