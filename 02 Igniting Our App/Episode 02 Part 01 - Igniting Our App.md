# _Igniting Our App ðŸš€_
### _Episode 02 Part 01_

## _What Igniting Our App means?_
- We have written code in <b>`HTML`, `CSS` and `JS`</b>, but is this code ready to Production? NO right
- This code is **not** **`fully optimiszd`, `random comments coming`, `console.logs`** etc.
- We want to minify our code, we want to bundle our code
- To make your code ready to **`production`**, you need a lot of **`processing in your local`**/ or a lot of processing before you put the code to production
- You need to basically do <b>`bundling`</b>, <b>`code spliting`</b>, <b>`chunking`</b>, <b>`compressing`</b> before you can make your code go to production

## _How you can make your production readdy app? <br>(without using npx create-react-app)_

## _What is not NPM?_
- NPM is everything, but not **`Node Package Manager`**
- NPM doesn't have a full form
- NPM manages packages but it does not stand for  **`Node Package Manager`**

## _What NPM actually is?_
- NPM is a Standard repository for all the packages
- Any package you need to include in your project, you use NPM
- All packages are hosted over there
