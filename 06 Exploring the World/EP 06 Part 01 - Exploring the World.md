# _Monolith and Microservice Architechture_

Monolithic architecture is a single deployable application where all modules are tightly coupled. Microservices architecture breaks the application into small independent services that communicate over APIs, allowing independent scaling and deployment.

### Why Microservices?

Microservices improve scalability, fault isolation, and team productivity but increase operational complexity and require DevOps maturity.
