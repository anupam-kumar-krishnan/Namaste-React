## What is `useEffect` in React JS?
useEffect is a React Hook used to handle side effects in functional components.

**👉 Side effects are tasks that happen outside rendering, such as:**
- Fetching data from an API
- Updating the DOM
- Subscribing/unsubscribing to events
- Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
- Logging, analytics
